            <h2><b>Matthew Lei</b></h2> 
            <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Lei, and I am a Georgia Tech first-year Computer Science major from Duluth, Georgia.</p>
            <p>I want to join Bits of Good because not only will it help me further my skills in web development, but it will also allow me to contribute to the community.</p>
            <p>While I empathize with many moves for social change, the main thing I am passionate about is bringing computer science to those with less exposure to it.</p>
            <p>When I was in elementary school, my dad took me to computer science bootcamps that taught me Scratch.</p>
            <p>Those activities jumpstarted my interest in the field, and I have learned much since while still having much left to do.</p>
            <p>As a result, I want the next generations to have the same opportunities as I did so that they may become interested to explore computer science.</p>
