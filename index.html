            <p style="color:Aquamarine; font-family: Arial">Hello, my name is Matthew Lei, and I am a Georgia Tech first-year Computer Science major from Duluth, Georgia.</p>
            <p style="color:Red; font-family: Helvetica" font>I want to join Bits of Good because not only will it help me further my skills in web development, but it will also allow me to contribute to the community.</p>
            <p style="color:Yellow; font-family: sans-serif">While there are certainly many moves for social change, the main thing I am passionate about is bringing computer science to those with less exposure to it.</p>
            <p style="color:Aqua; font-family: Times">When I was in elementary school, my dad took me to computer science bootcamps that taught me Scratch.</p>
            <p style="color:Grey; font-family: monospace">Those activities jumpstarted my interest in the field, and I have learned much since while still having much left to do.</p>
            <p style="color:Pink;">As a result, I want the next generations to have the same opportunities as I did so that they may become interested to explore computer science.</p>
            <p style="color:Beige">When I'm not doing schoolwork or learning more about programming, I really enjoy watching and reviewing films (have seen over 400 films for the first time since quarantine started).</p>
